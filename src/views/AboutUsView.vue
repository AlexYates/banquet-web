                <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                    Banquet Surf Co. was born from a simple idea shared between friends on a windswept coastline: the
                    gear we use should be as dedicated and passionate as the people who use it. We were tired of
                    equipment that didn't last and brands that felt disconnected from the soul of surfing.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                    We believe surfing is a feast for the sensesâ€”a banquet of experiences, from the pre-dawn patrol to
                    the sunset glass-off. Our mission is to provide you with the highest quality, most reliable gear so
                    you can focus on what truly matters: your next wave. We are a collective of surfers, shapers, and
                    ocean lovers, and this is our offering to the community we cherish.
